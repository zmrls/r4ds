# Overview - Data Exploration

![](data-exploration.png)

The goal of data exploration is to generate many promising leads that you can later explore in more depth.  

- For data visualization, ggplot2 is your friend. Allows for elegant and informative plots to understand the data.
- Visualization alone is not (usually) enough, transformation is useful to select/create variables, filter observations, and compute summaries.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) combines visualization, transformation, curiosity, and skepticism to ask and answer interesting questions about data.  

Modeling is also an integral part of EDA, but requires in depth knowledge of data wrangling and programming tools.
