```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### ggplot2

Visualizations are centered around the tidyverse package `ggplot2`. Install a package once, load it every time you start a new R session. Load tidyverse (including ggplot2) using:

```{r load, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

### 

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
